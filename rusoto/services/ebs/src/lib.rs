//! <p>You can use the Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) direct APIs to directly read the data on your EBS snapshots, and identify the difference between two snapshots. You can view the details of blocks in an EBS snapshot, compare the block difference between two snapshots, and directly access the data in a snapshot. If you're an independent software vendor (ISV) who offers backup services for EBS, the EBS direct APIs make it easier and more cost-effective to track incremental changes on your EBS volumes via EBS snapshots. This can be done without having to create new volumes from EBS snapshots.</p> <p>This API reference provides detailed information about the actions, data types, parameters, and errors of the EBS direct APIs. For more information about the elements that make up the EBS direct APIs, and examples of how to use them effectively, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-accessing-snapshot.html">Accessing the Contents of an EBS Snapshot</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide</i>. For more information about the supported AWS Regions, endpoints, and service quotas for the EBS direct APIs, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/ebs-service.html">Amazon Elastic Block Store Endpoints and Quotas</a> in the <i>AWS General Reference</i>.</p>
//!
//! If you're using the service, you're probably looking for [EbsClient](struct.EbsClient.html) and [Ebs](trait.Ebs.html).
