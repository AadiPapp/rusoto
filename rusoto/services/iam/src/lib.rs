//! <p><fullname>AWS Identity and Access Management</fullname> <p>AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service for securely controlling access to AWS services. With IAM, you can centrally manage users, security credentials such as access keys, and permissions that control which AWS resources users and applications can access. For more information about IAM, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/iam/">AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)</a> and the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/">AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide</a>.</p></p>
//!
//! If you're using the service, you're probably looking for [IamClient](struct.IamClient.html) and [Iam](trait.Iam.html).
